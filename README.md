# **Cinema Review System**

## **Overview**
This repository contains the implementation of the **Cinema Review System**, developed as part of my Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) coursework for the 2022/2023 academic year. The project simulates a platform where users can submit and manage reviews for movies, allowing other users to read and rate them. The system is designed using advanced Java programming techniques and emphasizes object-oriented principles like inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.

## **Project Description**
The **Cinema Review System** provides a platform for users to write and read reviews about various movies. The system stores information about movies, user reviews, and ratings. Users can interact with the platform to contribute reviews or browse existing ones. This project is designed with scalability and modularity in mind, using core OOP concepts to ensure maintainable and extendable code.

## **Features**
- **User Management**: Allows users to create profiles, submit reviews, and rate existing reviews.
- **Movie Management**: Movies can be added to the system, and detailed information such as genre, director, and release year is stored.
- **Review and Rating System**: Users can submit reviews for movies and rate existing reviews, with the system managing average ratings and top-rated reviews.
- **OOP Design**: Implements inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation to model users, movies, and reviews.
- **Data Persistence**: Saves reviews and ratings to persist data between sessions.

## **Key Concepts**
- **Inheritance & Polymorphism**: The system uses abstract classes and interfaces to model different types of users and content, allowing for flexibility in extending the system with new features.
- **Exception Handling**: Provides robust error handling to manage issues such as invalid input or duplicate entries.
- **Modularity**: Code is structured to allow easy expansion, such as adding new types of media (e.g., TV shows) in the future.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Java**: The core programming language used to develop the system.
- **JUnit**: Employed for unit testing to ensure that core functionalities perform as expected.
- **File I/O**: Used to save and load reviews and movie data between application runs.
- 

## **Future Improvements**
- **GUI Development**: Integrating a graphical user interface to improve user interaction with the system.
- **Recommendation System**: Implementing an algorithm to recommend movies based on user preferences and past reviews.
- **Social Features**: Adding features like comment sections on reviews and user follow systems.
